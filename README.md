# nginx-http-auth-totp

Time-based one-time password (TOTP) authentication for Nginx

The Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) algorithm, provides a secure mechanism for short-lived one-time password values, which are desirable for enhanced security. This algorithm can be used across a wide range of network applications ranging from remote Virtual Private Network (VPN) access, Wi-Fi network logon to transaction-orientated Web applications.

The nginx-http-auth-totp module provides TOTP authentication for a Nginx server.

## Build

To build the nginx-http-auth-totp module from the Nginx source directory:

    ./configure --add-module=/path/to/nginx-http-auth-totp
    make
    make install

## Configuration

## Directives

### auth_totp_file

* **syntax:** `auth_totp_file <filename>`
* **default:** -
* **context:** `http`, `server`, `location`, `limit_except`

Specifies the file that contains usernames, shared secrets, and optionally, time step in seconds and UNIX start time, for time-based one-time password authentication. This file should employ the following format:

    # comment
    user1:secret1
    user2:secret2:step2
    user3:secret3:step3:start3
    user4:secret4

If a time step in seconds or UNIX start time (in seconds since 1970/01/01) is specified in association with a user definition within this file, these values will override any values defined independently via the configuration directives `auth_totp_start` and `auth_totp_step`.

### auth_totp_realm

* **syntax:** `auth_totp_realm <string>|off`
* **default:** `off`
* **context:** `http`, `server`, `location`, `limit_except`

Enables validation of user name and time-based one-time password using the "HTTP Basic Authentication" protocol. The specified parameter is used as the `realm` for this authentication. This parameter value can contain variables. The special value of `off` cancels the application of any `auth_totp_realm` directive inherited from a higher configuration level.

### auth_totp_skew

* **syntax:** `auth_totp_skew <digit>`
* **default:** `0`
* **context:** `http`, `server`, `location`, `limit_except`

Specifies the number of time steps by which the time base between the issuing and validating TOTP systems.

Due to network latency, the gap between the time that a OTP was generated and the time that the OTP is received at the validating system may be large. Indeed, it is possible that the receiving time at the validating system and that when the OTP was generated by the issuing system may not fall within the same time-step window. Accordingly, the validating system should typically set a policy for an acceptable OTP transmission window for validation. In line with this, the validating system should compare OTPs not only with the receiving timestamp, but also the past timestamps that are within the transmission delay.

It is important to note that larger acceptable delay windows represent a larger window for attacks and a balance must be struck between the security and usability of OTPs.

### auth_totp_start

* **syntax:** `auth_totp_start <time>`
* **default:** `0`
* **context:** `http`, `server`, `location`, `limit_except`

Specifies the UNIX time from which to start counting time steps. 

The default value is 0, the UNIX epoch at 1970/01/01.

### auth_totp_step

* **syntax:** `auth_totp_step <interval>`
* **default:** `30s`
* **context:** `http`, `server`, `location`, `limit_except`
